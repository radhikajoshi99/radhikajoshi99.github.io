Aspects that have been correctly implemented:
1. an index.html that contains two links: one to a biography and one to a resume
  - it includes a picture and two buttons 
2. a biography.html that displays a brief biography of myself
3. a resume.html page that shows my resume with images 
In the future: I would like to add a home button that takes the user back to index.html from any page, as well as add more styling such as a better background and other kind of design features to increase the aesthetic appeal of the website. I would also like to make my website aesthetically appealing on both mobile and destop devices. Currently, I added the meta tag for resizing, but a v2 goal would be to resize the buttons and the text to make the website even more user friendly. Along with that, I think that adding more colors/styling effects/interactive elements would make the website more interesting and engaging.

I recieved help from Kingsley in office hours. 

I spent approximately 4-5 hours on this assignment.
